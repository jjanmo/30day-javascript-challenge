                <p>
                    By the time you've written your first few programs, you're likely getting somewhat comfortable with creating
                    variables and storing values in them. Working with variables is one of the most foundational things we do in
                    programming! But you may not have considered very closely the underlying mechanisms used by the engine to
                    organize and manage these variables. I don't mean how the memory is allocated on the computer, but rather: how
                    does JS know which variables are accessible by any given statement, and how does it handle two variables of
                    the same name? The answers to questions like these take the form of well-defined rules called scope. This book
                    will dig through all aspects of scope—how it works, what it's useful for, gotchas to avoid—and then point
                    toward common scope patterns that guide the structure of programs. Our first step is to uncover how the JS
                    engine processes our program before it runs.
